<p>According to Johnson (2021) over 80% of UK businesses have a website. In addition, many smaller businesses promote themselves through social media such as Facebook and Instagram with Shortt (2020) claiming that 95% of businesses worldwide use Facebook. All online presences will have been scanned at some point, whether it is by a spider deployed by a search engine, a script-kiddy testing basic vulnerability-scanning tools, or a nation-backed professional cyber-attack team intent on carrying out a malware delivery, denial of service attack or industrial espionage.
<br>One of the key skills of an Information Security professional is to be able to detect such attacks, qualify them as to the degree of seriousness of the breach, and to be able to deal with the intrusion as efficiently and quickly as possible, while minimising the damage both to the business and its reputation.
<br>This module will give you a grounding in security concepts and terminology, illustrated by hands on practice in one of the most important aspects of information security today â€“ network technology. We do not assume any prior knowledge of either topic, so we will start at the grass roots level, providing knowledge in the basics of both information security and network technology. We will use the latter to illustrate some very important security concepts such as vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, forensic analysis and breach management. We will conclude the module with a look at some of the challenges that face the Internet as we know it today, and consideration of how recent and emerging network technology can be used to mitigate some of the issues presented.
