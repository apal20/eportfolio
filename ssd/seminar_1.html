                        <p>ISO / IEC 27000 document is a comprehensive standard document that defines the basis of Information Security Management System. It includes the Techniques, Management System, Overview and Vocabulary and provides a model to follow in setting up and operating a management system. Some of the important factors on how people can be managed to overcome a cyber security attack from inside, taken up from Section 3 of the ISO 27000 document are:</p>
                        <ol>
                        <li><strong>Policy</strong>: Once an organisation has a well defined policy in place that is bound for every individual, then the risk of cyber security is lowered. The policy can be as simple as avoiding USB drives or not uploading confidential data on public portals.</li>
                        <br/>
                        <li><strong>Control</strong>: As per ISO 27000, control includes any process, policy, device, practice, or other actions with modify risk. A proper control on process and policy provides framework for working individuals to know their access boundary. These controls should be well coded in the applications being used in any organisations through RBAC mechanism.</li>
                        <br/>
                        <li><strong>Authentications</strong>: It is highly important to authorise any person in the organisation with ability to access the data. The authentication mechanism should be able to clearly identify and associate the person with the required credentials. This can include the use of Email or Phone Number based OTPs, Biometrics, Citizenship Recognition numbers (eg., SSN in USA or Aadhaar in India).</li>
                        <br/>
                        <li><strong>Confidentiality</strong>: It is defined as a property that information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes. With a defined set of policy and control, once the confidentiality of the data is maintained, the risk of Cyber Attack from Inside is mitigated to a great extent.</li>
                        <br/>
                        <li><strong>Internal Context</strong>: To mitigate the risk of cyber attack from inside, the most important factor is the internal context. This includes:
                        <ul>
                            <li>the governance, organizational structure, roles and accountabilites,</li>
                            <li>strategies that are in place to achieve the defined policies,</li>
                            <li>relationships with internal stakeholders,</li>
                            <li>information systems,</li>
                            <li>organisation culture,</li>
                            <li>standards, guidelines and models adopted</li>
                        </ul>
                        When the internal context of any organisation is managed properly, internal cyber attacks are reduced drastically.</li>
