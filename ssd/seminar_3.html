                        <p><strong>Python&nbsp;</strong></p>
                        <p>Python was first released in 1991 by Guido van Rossum. It is a multiparadigm programming language which is designed to be easily extendable and help programmers work efficiently in end-to-end software development.</p>
                        <p>The simplicity of Python means it has a relatively smaller learning curve than other programming languages,&nbsp;making it easier to get started.&nbsp;It has a huge collection of libraries and frameworks available to take advantage of.&nbsp;It can also&nbsp;integrate with a wide variety of different softwares,&nbsp;such as enterprise applications and databases. However, Python is an interpreted language, meaning it can be slower at times compared to compiled options such as C++ and Java. It is also quite easy to debug because of the availability of libraries .</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Rust</strong></p>
                        <p>Rust is a newer, multiparadigm general purpose programming language. It was introduced by Graydon Hoare of Mozilla Research. Rust focuses on stability, performance and safety.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Rust is designed for performance orientation, which means that it is much quicker and has more efficient memory architecture than other languages.</p>
                        <p>It also enforces strict safe memory allocations&nbsp;and secure coding practices, making it more stable and secure.&nbsp;However,&nbsp;Rust is slightly more complex than other languages, meaning it has a relatively higher learning curve compared to Python. It also has a relatively low level of support for monkey patching.</p>
                        <p>There are several aspects that make Python a better choice than Rust, including easiness of coding and understandable documentation. Python has a clear advantage with regards to extensibility because of the sheer number of libraries, software, and services that are available for Python or able to support Python.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, Rust offer higher performance than Python and offers better error handing. Rust gives programmers a choice of whether to store data on the stack or the heap. It is also completely memory safe unless the developer specifies otherwise.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Swift</strong></p>
                        <p>Swift is a relatively new programming lamguage. It was introduced at the WWDC conference in 2014 by Chris Latter. It is primarily used to create application for iOS. Among iOS applications written in Swift are Hubspot,Yahoo Weather and Khan Academy. The major advantages of Swift is that it is easy, safe, 8.4 times faster than Python,efficient memory management, open source , has huge potential and is inter operable. The drawbacks are that it has a limited talent pool, few native libraries and unstable, which means that if you have to switch to the newest version, you have to rewrite the code.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>F#</strong></p>
                        <p>&nbsp;F#&nbsp;is a strongly-typed, functional-first programming language for writing simple code to solve complex problems. It is a mature, open source, cross-platform, functional-first programming language. It empowers users and organizations to tackle complex computing problems with simple, maintainable and robust code. Both Python and F# belong to the&nbsp;<em>Languages&nbsp;</em>category of the tech stack. It is popular for its Pattern Matching and Libraries.</p>

                        <p><strong>Which one would I choose?</strong></p>
                        <p>In general,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.netguru.com/services/python-development">Python provides a simpler development experience</a> and is easier to get started with. It also has a bigger community and wider resource base to choose from, so offers better extensibility for potentially larger projects.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Rust, meanwhile, should be the preferred option if speed and security are your priorities. Its performance-orientation and memory safety make it ideal for projects such as system development, game engine development, and embedded integrations. These options make it clear that Rust will only continue to gain in popularity, and as it matures further.</p>
                        <p>Python is most praised for its elegant syntax and readable code, if you are just beginning your programming career python suits you best.&nbsp;Therefore, choosing between Python or Swift depends on the purpose. If mobile applications that will work seamlessly on the iOS need to be developed, Swift is the program of choice. Python is preferred in case we want to develop own AI or create a prototype.</p>
                        <p>Python again probably be my first choice, but F# makes a lot of sense as a scripting language. You have all of the .Net libraries you are already familiar with for file IO, database access, etc., as well as the ability to load assemblies from the projects you are working on, all while getting things done quickly with greatly reduced boilerplate from C#, powerful type inference, and type providers.</p>
                        <p>Thus, for a beginner to get well versed in Python is important. Rust, Swift and F# have their advantages depending on the nature of the project and purpose.</p>
