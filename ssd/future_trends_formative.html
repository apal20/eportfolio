                        <p>Microservices architecture advantages are allowing application scalability, resilience, integrity and agility but this inevitably can lead to challenges like the following difficulty of coordination across development teams, increased need for high speed network communication despite using REST API, need to consider adding network security as communications in microservices architecture uses exposed APIs. Also there is a need to split out data repositories which may lead to errors while using unstructured data repositories, thereby requiring robust recovery mechanisms to avoid data corruption. A dynamic service discovery and registry are required to ease up management and monitoring of containerized services and finally finding the right size and number of services, coming up with the most efficient microservice size for an application is a tricky process.</p>
                        <p>Keeping the above shortcomings in mind the next generation software development architecture should be based on unikernel structure, employ hands-off container systems and have broader serverless support employing virtual machines. Some of the newer systems being developed using HTTP/3 protocols ( based on QUIC network protocol and User datagram Protocol), include block chain technology, Cyberphysical systems (hybrid, heterogeneous, distributed, large-scale, dynamic, adaptive, human-in-the-loop), using the Fog layer for enhanced industrial data processing, , DevOps systems (which allows continuous delivery, integration and communication, analytics, feed back loops and cross functional support). The enhanced internet speed, implementation of 5G mobile netwroks in the present decade is likely to see these newer architectural systems being used to support complex application development.</p>
