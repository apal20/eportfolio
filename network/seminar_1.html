                    <p>Under discussions for Collaborative Discussions 1, we were asked to read the case study where
                    a group of students use the online tools to attack and check the vulnerabilities of the Medical
                    Devices on a Medical Mannequin. The summary post of the same can be accessed <a href="ns_collab_1.html">here</a>.</p>

                    <p>
                        In this seminar, we discussed the DREAD ratings on the same article and evaluate the level of vulnerabilities
                        on a scale of 0 to 3 where 0 = no risk and 3 = maximum risk. The DREAD tool was reorganised for the same. The detail
                        on each entry of DREAD is given below.
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Damage Potential (3)</b>: Under this category, we have given the maximum rating of 3 (that is Destruction of information or data).
                            We have assumed that once the PIN was broken and the access to the device was available, the damage potential is
                            maximum possibility.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Reproducibility (1)</b>: It is assumed that once the PIN of the devices are changed, it will take more than 9 hours to detect a PIN using Brute Force Attack.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Exploitability (2)</b>: As we see in the case study that the students used some attack tools such as BackTrack, etc to exploit the vulnerabilities,
                            it is assumed that although the attack will need some tools, but not high level advance programming skills.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Affected Users (0.5)</b>: As per the case study, the affected users will be limited to only 1 per attack, which is the patient.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Discoverability (2)</b>: As per the case study, the students found out the vulnerabilities from the information available in public domain.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>So the total score of the DREAD rating stands at <b>8.5 out of 15</b>. This shows that the devices are moderately vulnerable to the attacks.</p>
