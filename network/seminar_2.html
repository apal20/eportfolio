                    <p>Transmission Control Protocol, developed gradually by the IETF (originating from ARPA to IAB),
                        without the kings, presidents and voting, through rough consensus of the participants and
                        running codes, stood far ahead against the International Standards Organisation’s Open Systems
                        Interconnection (OSI).</p>

                    <p>The bureaucratic governance of the OSI resembled contemporary democartic bodies in so far as it
                        featured voting, partisan compromises, and rule making behaviour designed to protect financial
                        interests. These international standards were written as documents to be obeyed and enjoyed this
                        widespread support from national governments particularly in Western Europe, North America, and
                        Far East. OSI enjoyed this level of support due to the strategic position of its sponsor, ISO.
                    </p>

                    <p>In contrast to it, Transmission Control Protocol was developed by the network users – technical
                        experts distributed in universities, firms and government agencies. These Internet standards
                        tended to be those written for implementers. The ulitmate goal was to make the network
                        transparent, “a seamless whole”, invisible to the user who would be more interested in accessing
                        information over the network instead of the operation of the network itself. Network
                        Transparency and Application Autonomy were the two key elements behind the Internet Protocols.
                        The end-to-end design principal, calls for a simple standard for data transfer allowing new
                        innovations to be added at the edges and on top of the “stupid network”.</p>

                    <p>Considering the modern Internet, where we are surrounded by the mobile applications, social
                        media, ecommerce, instant messaging platforms, VoIP, wireless networking technologies such as
                        WiFi and mobile data, it seems that no user has any idea about how the “stupid network” is
                        working and is using the end-to-end deisgn principle to transfer the data from one node to
                        another. A user coming from a low income background with minimum to no knowledge of modern
                        computing and technology, is able to operate a mobile handset easily and use all the service
                        available and access the vast information available on the Internet.</p>

                    <p>From the article, it is evident that the proprieratory networks established by the IBM and DEC
                        stood no chance against the open networks. In general, the open systems encourage compatibility
                        between systems from different manufacturers. Adoption of these open systems, no matter if they
                        came from a tech giant such as Microsoft or from the Open Source groups such as that led for the
                        development of the Linux, provided the developers to build web applications that can be used on
                        any browser, or accessed on any platform. This in turn provided the users a freedom to choose
                        the applications and device of their own choice while able to connect to the internet without
                        any hassle. In modern times, these systems provided a seamless connection between mobile devices
                        or desktop / laptops and hide the underlying layers from the users.</p>

                    <p>It is highly evident from above that the TCP/IP has made the world a better place and no matter
                        how many governments or organisations laid out the rules for the inter-connection of the
                        devices. The systems developed by the <em><strong>Rough Consensus and Running Code</strong></em>
                        paved a path for the future. With IPv6 being arrived and exponential increase in number of
                        devices (Internet of Things / Machine to Machine communication), TCP/IP will provide a very
                        solid foundation.</p>
