<p>In this module, launching into network and information security management, I learnt a lot of things through various articles and case studies about how a cyber attack is caused and is prevented in various places and organizations. Also got to know various techniques to prevent cyber crime, various tools for penetration testing and various governing bodies  such as HIPAA, GDPR(General Data Protection Plan) which set rules to prevent data breaches as well as cybercrimes.</p>
<p>There were 12 units with 7 live seminar sessions  linked to specific activities for us to complete along which were to be discussed in the seminar. We also had to perform various group activities such as website scanning, etc along with making design documents, individual peer review and an executive summary based on that.</p>
<p>The module also gave us a grounding in security concepts and terminology, illustrated by hands-on practice in one of the most important aspects of information security today &ndash; network technology.</p>
<p>The latter was used to illustrate some very important security concepts such as vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, forensic analysis and breach management.</p>
<p>The module concluded finally with a look at some of the challenges that face the Internet as we know it today, and consideration of how recent and emerging network technology can be used to mitigate some of the issues presented.</p>
<p>This module was different from the previous ones, because it involved group work and team projects. Therefore, our tutor divided the whole class into groups of three namely- group 1, group 2 and group 3. I was in group 3 along with four others.  This group was really hard working and cooperative and displayed exuberant sportsmanship. Whenever I had any doubt, my team would always try to help me out. Even my module tutor, Mr.Nekat, was extremely supportive and friendly and would always try to help us out and clear our doubts whenever possible.</p>
<p>In the sixth unit, I became aware of various tools for penetration testing and also made a chart for comparing each of them on the basis of different criteria. Following this, the amazing read on the details of Kali Linux was an eye opener. All the given case studies also provided more details on using Kali as an operating system with all the available open source pen testing tools available as a package.</p>
<p>For the case study on GDPR in unit 8, I undertook the case study on &ldquo;Failure by the Department of Justice and Equality to impose the correct access restrictions on access to medical data of an employee&rdquo;. The intricacies of how a simple mismanagement of the data by a senior management person can lead to serious leak of the medical data of an employee and possible provision of it being viewed by all the employees of the organization, throws the light on importance of critical data management and the policies that should be built around it. The importance of proper logging helped me in becoming a better cyber security expert as the logs are the gateways to finding out what happened at the time of any security breach. </p>
<p>Towards the end of the module, it became important to understand what are the challenges that are being faced by us as a community with respect to the newer technologies, shortcomings of the IPv4, increasing use of the content with the advancement of social media and increase in use of mobile devices. This helped me in understanding that we need to be prepared with the newer challenges of data breach and cyber security risks.</p>
<p>As a closing note, I would like to say that entire module took us on a roller coaster ride of where got to understand </p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>the basic network details, networking model and how they were created,</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>the use of advanced technologies to test the existing system,</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p> the rules and regulations and the policy frameworks that should be in place to create and manage the IT systems,</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>how to do a forensic analysis on any security breach, and</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p> the future of the network, its associated risks and challenges, and advancement in technologies.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>With the advancement in the fields of Artificial Intelligence, and Virtual Reality such as Metaverse, the challenges and dimensions of cyber security are bound to increase by leaps and bounds.</p>
