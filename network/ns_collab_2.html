                    <p>The activity to run some basic tests on the website assigned to Group 2 &ndash;
                        customerrus.co.uk, provided us various insiights, both as individually and as a group.
                        Individually, I was able to find the number of hops it took, and the time for a packet to reach
                        the website server using traceroute. I was also able to find the registration details and MX
                        records using the Whois. I came to know from my group members the impact of firewalls and
                        geographical location when trying to reach a web service. The delays caused due to the firewalls
                        and from different locations was noteworthy. The discussion on the location of the server and
                        the various view points on the subject brought some interesting points. The location of server
                        was judged to be in USA or in Europe based on the IP location. In my point, the server is
                        located in USA as per the geolocation traced .</p>
                    <p>Our group members also worked individually on this. Jonathan tried Kali Linux, Nmap, mtr,
                        traceroute and tracert to &nbsp;discover how many hops to the website, and to &nbsp;if there was
                        consistency. Tebogo mentioned some challenges &nbsp;encountered during the exercise, like the
                        &ldquo;whois&rdquo; command &nbsp;not being available by default and had to be downloaded and
                        installed. Also , the traceroute command yielded various results due to varying locations where
                        the tests were done. Adrijana also used traceroute.com to trace the location of the server.</p>
                    <p>The results indicates that the administrative information were basically the same for each of the
                        test and tools used except for traceroute which was quite different for each team member. This
                        difference was due to several factors but the most visible is that of geography since the group
                        members performing the test where located in different countries and traceroute usually
                        initiates a trace from the source of the trace(Wilson, 2019).</p>
                    <p>In my opinion , this discussion had some learning points. Cybercriminals routinely use stealth
                        technology to evade detection and attribution (Campbell, 2016). One must always be on ones toes
                        &nbsp;and factor in geo location variations to successfully detect cyber threats .</p>
