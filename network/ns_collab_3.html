                    <p> <strong>Initial Post</strong> </p>
                    <p>I have chosen the eleventh case study in the year 2017 which is &apos;Failure by the
                        Department of Justice and Equality to impose the correct access restrictions on access to
                        medical data of an employee&apos;.</p>
                    <p>In this article, a report containing information on the employee&apos;s health had been
                        accidentally uploaded to a general departmental open document management database by the line
                        manager in 2012, which then remained on that database for up to three years where it could be
                        accessed by approximately 80 employees. The employee had requested an explanation from the
                        Department as to why the report had been placed on an open database but had not received
                        official confirmation that the report had since been removed for which the department confirmed
                        that notes relating to a discussion which had taken place between the complainant and their line
                        manager in 2012 (which included a note concerning the complainant&rsquo;s health) had been
                        stored to the database in question and marked private. However, the line manager had
                        inadvertently omitted to restrict access to the document with the result that it could be
                        accessed by approximately 80 staff members from the Department. They later informed that the
                        document had been removed from the database some three years ago after being saved on the
                        computer. As the line manager in question had since left the Department, it had been unable to
                        establish exactly why the document had been saved there in the first place but claimed that it
                        was due to human error.At the end, the department was also unable to establish how many staff
                        had actually accessed the document during those three years in which it was accessible as the
                        department&rsquo;s IT section had been unable to restore the historic data in question. At last,
                        the department made an offer, as a way of resolving the matter to the employee in writing by
                        confirming that the document in question had been removed from the database and apologising for
                        any distress caused. But, the employee chose not to accept this offer and instead sought a
                        formal decision of the Commissioner.In her decision, the Commissioner concluded that the
                        Department had contravened Section 2A(1) and 2B(1) of the Data Protection Acts 1988 &amp; 2003
                        by processing the complainant&rsquo;s sensitive personal data without the required consent or
                        another valid legal basis for doing so and by disclosing the complainant&rsquo;s sensitive
                        personal data to at least one third party.</p>
                    <p>The GDPR defines an array of legal terms at length. Below are some of the most important ones
                        that are referred to, in this article:</p>
                    <p>Personal data &mdash; Personal data is any information that relates to an
                        individual who can be directly or indirectly identified. Names and email addresses are obviously
                        personal data. Location information, ethnicity, gender, biometric data, religious beliefs, web
                        cookies, and political opinions can also be personal data.</p>
                    <p>Data processing &mdash; Any action performed on data, whether automated or manual.
                        The examples cited in the text include collecting, recording, organising, structuring, storing,
                        using, erasing, etc.</p>
                    <p>Data processor &mdash; A third party that processes personal data on behalf of a
                        data controller.</p>
                    <p>Data controller &mdash; The person who decides why and how personal data will be
                        processed, i.e an owner or employee in your organisation who handles data.</p>
                    <p>Data subject &mdash; The person whose data is processed, such as customers and site
                        visitors.</p>
                    <p>If I was the information Security manager in this organisation, then I would have had
                        adequate regular audit and review measures in place for evaluating the appropriateness of
                        documents stored to open access databases as well as adequate system of training and ensuring
                        awareness by staff managers of basic data protection rules in order to solve to mitigate the
                        issue.</p>

                    <p> <strong>Summary Post</strong> </p>

                    <p>In this collaborative discussion, we reviewed a number of case studies involving GDPR
                        investigations undertaken by the Data Protection Commission (2020). Many of these case studies
                        involved data subject access requests (DSARs), some involved accidental data breaches and loss
                        while others focussed on the peculiarities of non electronic forms of data which are not subject
                        to electronic encryption.</p>
                    <p>For my case study, I selected the case study titled &quot;Failure by the Department of Justice
                        and Equality to impose the correct access restrictions on access to medical data of an
                        employee.&quot; Due to the human error by the department&apos;s personnel, the medical report
                        information of an employee was wrongly posted on an open access site accessed by other
                        employees, the act violated the Data Protection Act of 1988 and 2003. The Act controls how
                        employers acquire, store, and utilize the personal information of their workers. I &nbsp;believe
                        that a company&apos;s information security system should contain data/security alerts, a defined
                        retention policy for all sensitive personal data, and regular audit of the procedures for
                        storing of datasets and proper information security training for employees.</p>
                    <p>In response to my post, Jubet (2022)made some important observations related to the human factor
                        as a cause of breach, to quote: &ldquo;The human factor in security breaches is a very important
                        factor to consider in evaluating the effectiveness of any security measure. The question an IT
                        professional should ask is not just &ldquo;which security solution do we like best&rdquo; but
                        &ldquo;which security solution best factors in human behavior&rdquo;(Wang, 2014). Regular staff
                        training to educate them on Data protection should also be a common denominator of all security
                        measures.&rdquo; He also pointed out that there are response tools such Data Loss Prevention
                        (DLP) which can monitor and gather information from systems logs, identify sensitive data and
                        ensure it is not lost or leaked, while also setting remediation processes for responsible
                        parties, to remediate these potential breaches within a time frame(Imperva.com, N.D). &nbsp;</p>
                    <p>According to &nbsp;J Jubet., (2022) data breaches are happening at an alarming rate following the
                        increasing awareness among cyber criminals of the value of personal data. This issue was
                        highlighted by the missing evidence case study which may lead to a person losing their court
                        case and could lead to other more serious complications if the data was illegally accessed by
                        cyber criminals. The far reaching implication of this type of breach calls for stringent and
                        fool proof measures of data protection to be employed and at the same time have inbuilt
                        mechanisms to allow appropriate review/audit of these methods from time to time.</p>
                    <p>E Cook., (2022) highlighted the challenge with none electronic forms of data which cannot be
                        protected by encryption and access controls. Cook also advised that a control measure such as an
                        audit process to sign in and out the evidence materials should be enforced to avoid a repeat of
                        this type of data breach (Cook, 2022).</p>
                    <p>Jonathan&rsquo;s A.,(2022) case study examines the use of CCTV video in a disciplinary proceeding
                        involving a security officer who was tasked to monitor the CCTV system at night. The pre-GDPR
                        complaint was filed under the Data Protection Acts 1988-2003 of the Republic of Ireland (Data
                        Protection Commission, 2018). I feel that legal safeguards should be in place for the
                        controller&apos;s or a third party&apos;s legitimate interests unless those interests are
                        outweighed by the data subject&apos;s interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.</p>
