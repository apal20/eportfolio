                    <p> <strong>Summary Post</strong> </p>

                    <p>In this collaborative discussion, we reviewed a number of case studies involving GDPR
                        investigations undertaken by the Data Protection Commission (2020). Many of these case studies
                        involved data subject access requests (DSARs), some involved accidental data breaches and loss
                        while others focussed on the peculiarities of non electronic forms of data which are not subject
                        to electronic encryption.</p>
                    <p>For my case study, I selected the case study titled &quot;Failure by the Department of Justice
                        and Equality to impose the correct access restrictions on access to medical data of an
                        employee.&quot; Due to the human error by the department&apos;s personnel, the medical report
                        information of an employee was wrongly posted on an open access site accessed by other
                        employees, the act violated the Data Protection Act of 1988 and 2003. The Act controls how
                        employers acquire, store, and utilize the personal information of their workers. I &nbsp;believe
                        that a company&apos;s information security system should contain data/security alerts, a defined
                        retention policy for all sensitive personal data, and regular audit of the procedures for
                        storing of datasets and proper information security training for employees.</p>
                    <p>In response to my post, Jubet (2022)made some important observations related to the human factor
                        as a cause of breach, to quote: &ldquo;The human factor in security breaches is a very important
                        factor to consider in evaluating the effectiveness of any security measure. The question an IT
                        professional should ask is not just &ldquo;which security solution do we like best&rdquo; but
                        &ldquo;which security solution best factors in human behavior&rdquo;(Wang, 2014). Regular staff
                        training to educate them on Data protection should also be a common denominator of all security
                        measures.&rdquo; He also pointed out that there are response tools such Data Loss Prevention
                        (DLP) which can monitor and gather information from systems logs, identify sensitive data and
                        ensure it is not lost or leaked, while also setting remediation processes for responsible
                        parties, to remediate these potential breaches within a time frame(Imperva.com, N.D). &nbsp;</p>
                    <p>According to &nbsp;J Jubet., (2022) data breaches are happening at an alarming rate following the
                        increasing awareness among cyber criminals of the value of personal data. This issue was
                        highlighted by the missing evidence case study which may lead to a person losing their court
                        case and could lead to other more serious complications if the data was illegally accessed by
                        cyber criminals. The far reaching implication of this type of breach calls for stringent and
                        fool proof measures of data protection to be employed and at the same time have inbuilt
                        mechanisms to allow appropriate review/audit of these methods from time to time.</p>
                    <p>E Cook., (2022) highlighted the challenge with none electronic forms of data which cannot be
                        protected by encryption and access controls. Cook also advised that a control measure such as an
                        audit process to sign in and out the evidence materials should be enforced to avoid a repeat of
                        this type of data breach (Cook, 2022).</p>
                    <p>Jonathan&rsquo;s A.,(2022) case study examines the use of CCTV video in a disciplinary proceeding
                        involving a security officer who was tasked to monitor the CCTV system at night. The pre-GDPR
                        complaint was filed under the Data Protection Acts 1988-2003 of the Republic of Ireland (Data
                        Protection Commission, 2018). I feel that legal safeguards should be in place for the
                        controller&apos;s or a third party&apos;s legitimate interests unless those interests are
                        outweighed by the data subject&apos;s interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.</p>
