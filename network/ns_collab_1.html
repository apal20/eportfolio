<p>Medical training devices are becoming increasingly dependent on technology, creating opportunities that are inherently conducive to security breaches(Neilly,2013). In the article given to us, the students used DOS (Denial of Service) and Brute Force attack approach by looking at various published iStan documentations to breach into functioning of the medical training mannequin (Glisson,2015).
<br>Ahmad mentioned in his initial post that since various healthcare tools are at a high risk of cyber-attacks, medical training facilities are not spared. He suggested mitigation of threats by promoting collaboration between healthcare providers and cyber security professionals to ensure that hospitals develop effective programs for preventing hackers from compromising vital devices (Jalali,2020).
<p>Peuhkurinen in his initial Post mentioned that in addition to the WPS vulnerability, Glisson et. al. used a tool called MDK3 to demonstrate that the iStan is susceptible to denial of service attacks.MDK3 was designed to perform stress tests and penetration tests against wireless networks (Sankar,2018). Wireless denial of service attacks are extremely difficult to prevent, and as a result the best mitigation may be to deploy a wireless intrusion detection system (TechTarget,2009).
One may also adopt Block Chain Programming to mitigate these threats.<br>Blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system. A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain.
<p>Okafor–Tolofari in her post rightly suggested that the best defence against password attacks is ensuring that passwords are as strong as they can be. Multi-Factor authentication and Honeypot systems are beneficial for detecting attackers. This requires establishing the proper authentication, privacy and confidentiality mechanisms,(Pankaj,2005).
<p>It is very important to handle cybersecurity threats in the field of medicine as it can be a question of life and death. Future research should investigate the integration of customized dictionaries in order to reduce the overall time associated with the brute force attack.<br>Finally,the Cybersecurity Framework Protocol suggests a step wise process to mitigate threats by identifying, protecting, detecting,responding and recovering. This way one may aim to have universally secure medical equipment and devices.
<br>The ‘human factor’ has been recognized as the weakest link in creating safe and secure digital environments – but human intuition may also be the solution to thwarting many cyber threats. Every software or security monitoring system finally requires human interpretation of alerts.</p>
